# Car-Detection-
Car Detection using YOLO with Non-Max Suppression (NMS) &amp; IoU
A TensorFlow/Keras implementation of YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection, featuring:
✅ Non-Max Suppression (NMS) to eliminate duplicate detections
✅ Intersection over Union (IoU) for bounding box evaluation
✅ Pre-trained YOLO model (supports COCO classes)
✅ Visualization of detected objects with labels & confidence scores
